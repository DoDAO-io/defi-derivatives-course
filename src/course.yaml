  Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an
  underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest
  rates, or market indexes. Examples of derivatives include options, futures,
  and swaps. They are used to hedge against risk, speculate on price movements,
  or earn additional income.


  In this course we will study

  1.  Chapter 1 - What are derivatives and different types

  2. Chapter 2 - Using Perpetual Contracts in dYdX

    details: >-
      dYdX is a decentralized crypto derivatives exchange that enables users to
      trade perpetual contracts, margin trade, and leverage their position.
      Perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that do not have a fixed
      expiry date or time, meaning traders can hold a long or short position
      indefinitely - provided they have the margin to do so. Perpetuals trade
      closely to spot market prices because they rely on a funding rate system.


      By trading perpetuals, crypto traders can take advantage of market
      movements, reduce risk, and make a profit by going long or short with
      leverage on a futures contract. 


      In this module of the course, we will cover 

      - How to trade perpetual contracts in dYdX

      - How to take long or short positions

      - How leverage works in dYdX

      - The types of orders that can be executed using the protocol.

      GMX is a decentralized, non-restrictive, continuous trading platform for
      both spot and perpetual swap transactions. Simply connect a wallet to
      trade cryptocurrency on-chain effortlessly. The GMX protocol has its own
      token named GMX, which serves as a governance, utility and reward token.
      Stake GMX tokens to receive a share of GMX protocol fees and additional
      benefits. Currently, GMX operates on the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks.

      The Research Team at Opyn (Zubin Koticha, Andrew Leone, Alexis Gauba,
      Aparna Krishnan), Dave White, and Dan Robinson have invented Squeeth, a
      new financial derivative. Squeeth, also known as squared ETH, is the first
      Power Perpetual that gives traders perpetual exposure to ETH².


      The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by
      either going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth
      (squared-ETH) and the Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that
      enable trading of this index.


      Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
      instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or
      expiries, consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single
      ERC20 token. Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on
      long positions in Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This
      makes the long position a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be
      traded independently, such as in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans.
      This composability is a major advantage in Squeeth's design, making it
      easy to integrate into other projects.
