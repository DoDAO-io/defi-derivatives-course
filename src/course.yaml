  Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an
  underlying asset, such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest
  rates, or market indexes. Examples of derivatives include options, futures,
  and swaps. They are used to hedge against risk, speculate on price movements,
  or earn additional income.

    title: dYdX
    details: >-
      dYdX is a decentralized crypto derivatives exchange that enables users to
      trade perpetual contracts, margin trade, and leverage their position.
      Perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that do not have a fixed
      expiry date or time, meaning traders can hold a long or short position
      indefinitely - provided they have the margin to do so. Perpetuals trade
      closely to spot market prices because they rely on a funding rate system.


      By trading perpetuals, crypto traders can take advantage of market
      movements, reduce risk, and make a profit by going long or short with
      leverage on a futures contract. 


      In this module of the course, we will cover 

      - How to trade perpetual contracts in dYdX

      - How to take long or short positions

      - How leverage works in dYdX

      - The types of orders that can be executed using the protocol.
