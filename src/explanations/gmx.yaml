    ### Staking

    Staked GMX receives three types of rewards:

    - Escrowed GMX

    - Multiplier Points

    - ETH / AVAX Rewards


    30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH /
    AVAX and distributed to staked GMX tokens. If you are staking on Arbitrum
    you would receive ETH, if you are staking on Avalanche then you would
    receive AVAX. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after
    deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs
    are usually around 1% of the total fees.


    ### Floor Price Fund

    The GMX token has a floor price fund in ETH and GLP. It grows in two ways:

    - GMX/ETH liquidity is provided and owned by the protocol, the fees from
    this trading pair will be converted to GLP and deposited into the floor
    price fund

    - 50% of funds received through Olympus bonds are sent to the floor price
    fund, the other 50% is used for marketing 


    The current floor price fund is viewable on the Dashboard.


    The floor price fund helps to ensure liquidity in GLP and provide a reliable
    stream of ETH rewards for all staked GMX.


    As the floor price fund grows, it can also be used to buyback and burn GMX
    if the (Floor Price Fund) / (Total Supply of GMX) is less than the market
    price, this would lead to a minimum price for GMX in terms of ETH and GLP.
