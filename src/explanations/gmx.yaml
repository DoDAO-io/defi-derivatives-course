  title: GLP Token
  shortTitle: GLP Token
  details: >+
    GLP is the token that provides liquidity to the platform. It is made up of a
    collection of assets used for swapping and leverage trading. You can create
    GLP tokens using any of the index assets and convert them back into index
    assets at a price that's calculated based on the total value of assets in
    the index (including profits and losses from open positions) divided by the
    GLP supply.


    Holders of GLP tokens earn Escrowed GMX rewards and receive 70% of platform
    fees, which are distributed in ETH on Arbitrum and AVAX on Avalanche. Keep
    in mind that these fees take into account referral rewards and network costs
    for keepers (usually around 1% of total fees).


    It's important to note that GLP is specific to the network where it's minted
    and is not directly transferable between networks. The price and rewards for
    GLP tokens will vary between networks. The performance of GLP, including
    past PnL data and price chart, can be viewed at https://stats.gmx.io. Keep
    in mind that as a liquidity provider, the profit or loss of GLP holders is
    tied to the success or failure of leverage traders.


    ## Minting and Rebalancing

    The fees for minting GLP, burning GLP, or executing swaps will vary based on
    whether the action increases or decreases the balance of assets in the
    index. For example, if the index has a large proportion of ETH and a small
    proportion of USDC, actions that add to the ETH in the index will incur a
    high fee, while actions that decrease the ETH will have a low fee.


    The token weights are adjusted to hedge GLP holders based on the trading
    positions of traders. For instance, if many traders have long positions on
    ETH, ETH will have a higher token weight, and if many traders have short
    positions, stablecoins will have a higher token weight.

  title: GMX & GLP Tokens
  shortTitle: GMX Token
  details: >+
    ## GMX

    GMX is the platform's utility and governance token, holding the token
    unlocks a variety of benefits.

    After staking GMX, you will receive a staked GMX token.


    ### Escrowed GMX

    Escrowed GMX (esGMX) can be used in two ways:

    1. Staked for rewards similar to regular GMX tokens

    2. Vested to become actual GMX tokens over a period of one year


    Each staked Escrowed GMX token will earn the same amount of Escrowed GMX and
    ETH / AVAX rewards as a regular GMX token.


    ### Staked GMX

    Staked GMX receives three types of rewards:

    - Escrowed GMX

    - Multiplier Points

    - ETH / AVAX Rewards


    30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH /
    AVAX and distributed to staked GMX tokens. If you are staking on Arbitrum
    you would receive ETH, if you are staking on Avalanche then you would
    receive AVAX. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after
    deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs
    are usually around 1% of the total fees.


    ### Vesting


    The esGMX tokens can be transformed into GMX tokens through a process called
    vesting. During vesting, the average amount of GMX or GLP tokens used to
    earn the esGMX rewards will be reserved. For instance, if you staked 1000
    GMX and received 100 esGMX tokens, then to vest 100 esGMX tokens, 1000 GMX
    tokens will be set aside. The actual ratio may vary based on your staked
    amount and rewards earned.


    Once vesting has been initiated, esGMX tokens will no longer earn rewards.
    However, the GMX tokens reserved for vesting will still earn rewards. The
    esGMX tokens will be converted into GMX tokens over a period of 365 days.
    Once they are fully converted, they can be claimed at any time.


    If you sell GMX or GLP tokens and later wish to vest your esGMX rewards,
    you'll need to purchase those tokens again. You can use GMX, esGMX or
    Multiplier Points to fulfill the required reserve amount.


    It's possible to deposit into the vesting vault while ongoing vesting is in
    progress.


    ### Floor Price Fund

    The GMX token has a floor price fund in ETH and GLP. It grows in two ways:

    - GMX/ETH liquidity is provided and owned by the protocol, the fees from
    this trading pair will be converted to GLP and deposited into the floor
    price fund

    - 50% of funds received through Olympus bonds are sent to the floor price
    fund, the other 50% is used for marketing 


    The current floor price fund is viewable on the Dashboard.


    The floor price fund helps to ensure liquidity in GLP and provide a reliable
    stream of ETH rewards for all staked GMX.


    As the floor price fund grows, it can also be used to buyback and burn GMX
    if the (Floor Price Fund) / (Total Supply of GMX) is less than the market
    price, this would lead to a minimum price for GMX in terms of ETH and GLP.
