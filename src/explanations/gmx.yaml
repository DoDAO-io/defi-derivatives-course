    ### Staking

    Staked GMX receives three types of rewards:

    - Escrowed GMX

    - Multiplier Points

    - ETH / AVAX Rewards


    30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH /
    AVAX and distributed to staked GMX tokens. If you are staking on Arbitrum
    you would receive ETH, if you are staking on Avalanche then you would
    receive AVAX. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after
    deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs
    are usually around 1% of the total fees.
