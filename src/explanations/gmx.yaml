    ## GMX

    GMX is the platform's utility and governance token, holding the token
    unlocks a variety of benefits.

    After staking GMX, you will receive a staked GMX token.


    ### Escrowed GMX

    Escrowed GMX (esGMX) can be used in two ways:

    1. Staked for rewards similar to regular GMX tokens

    2. Vested to become actual GMX tokens over a period of one year


    Each staked Escrowed GMX token will earn the same amount of Escrowed GMX and
    ETH / AVAX rewards as a regular GMX token.


    ### Staked GMX

    Staked GMX receives three types of rewards:

    - Escrowed GMX

    - Multiplier Points

    - ETH / AVAX Rewards


    30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH /
    AVAX and distributed to staked GMX tokens. If you are staking on Arbitrum
    you would receive ETH, if you are staking on Avalanche then you would
    receive AVAX. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after
    deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs
    are usually around 1% of the total fees.


    ### Vesting


    The esGMX tokens can be transformed into GMX tokens through a process called
    vesting. During vesting, the average amount of GMX or GLP tokens used to
    earn the esGMX rewards will be reserved. For instance, if you staked 1000
    GMX and received 100 esGMX tokens, then to vest 100 esGMX tokens, 1000 GMX
    tokens will be set aside. The actual ratio may vary based on your staked
    amount and rewards earned.


    Once vesting has been initiated, esGMX tokens will no longer earn rewards.
    However, the GMX tokens reserved for vesting will still earn rewards. The
    esGMX tokens will be converted into GMX tokens over a period of 365 days.
    Once they are fully converted, they can be claimed at any time.


    If you sell GMX or GLP tokens and later wish to vest your esGMX rewards,
    you'll need to purchase those tokens again. You can use GMX, esGMX or
    Multiplier Points to fulfill the required reserve amount.


    It's possible to deposit into the vesting vault while ongoing vesting is in
    progress.


    ### Floor Price Fund

    The GMX token has a floor price fund in ETH and GLP. It grows in two ways:

    - GMX/ETH liquidity is provided and owned by the protocol, the fees from
    this trading pair will be converted to GLP and deposited into the floor
    price fund

    - 50% of funds received through Olympus bonds are sent to the floor price
    fund, the other 50% is used for marketing 


    The current floor price fund is viewable on the Dashboard.


    The floor price fund helps to ensure liquidity in GLP and provide a reliable
    stream of ETH rewards for all staked GMX.


    As the floor price fund grows, it can also be used to buyback and burn GMX
    if the (Floor Price Fund) / (Total Supply of GMX) is less than the market
    price, this would lead to a minimum price for GMX in terms of ETH and GLP.

  shortTitle: GLP Token
  details: >-
    GLP is the platform's liquidity provider token.


    GLP consists of an index of assets used for swaps and leverage trading. 


    It can be minted using any index asset and burnt to redeem any index asset.
    The price for minting and redemption is calculated based on (total worth of
    assets in index including profits and losses of open positions) / (GLP
    supply).



    For Arbitrum, holders of the GLP token earn Escrowed GMX rewards and 70% of
    platform fees distributed in ETH. For Avalanche, holders of the GLP token
    earn Escrowed GMX rewards and 70% of platform fees distributed in AVAX. Note
    that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral
    rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs are usually around 1%
    of the total fees.


    Note that GLP is specific to the network you mint it on, it is not directly
    transferrable between networks and the price / rewards to the tokens will
    differ between networks.

    As GLP holders provide liquidity for leverage trading, they will make a
    profit when leverage traders make a loss and vice versa. Past PnL data, GLP
    price chart and other stats can be viewed on https://stats.gmx.io.
