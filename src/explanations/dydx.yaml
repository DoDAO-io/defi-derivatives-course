  details: >-
    Perpetual Contracts are synthetic trading markets that allow for exposure to
    arbitrary liquid assets using stablecoin (USDC) collateral. By trading
    Perpetuals, you can participate in market movements, reduce risk, and make a
    profit by going long or short with leverage on a futures contract. 


    You can start trading with as little as $10 at http://dydx.exchange/.


    Long


    By going long, a trader buys a Perpetual contract with the expectation that
    the underlying asset will rise in value in the future. Rather than buying
    and holding the underlying asset, traders buy synthetic exposure to the
    asset.


    Short


    By going short, a trader sells a Perpetual contract with the expectation
    that the underlying asset will decline in value in the future. Rather than
    selling the underlying asset, traders sell synthetic exposure to the asset.
