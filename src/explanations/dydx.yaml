  details: >-
    Perpetual contracts are synthetic trading markets that allow traders to take
    positions on a variety of assets using stablecoin (USDC) collateral. These
    contracts can be used to speculate on market movements, hedge risk, or earn
    profits by going long or short with leverage on a futures contract.


    You can start trading with as little as $10 at http://dydx.exchange/.


    ### Long

    If a trader believes that the price of an underlying asset will increase in
    the future, they may choose to enter into a perpetual contract for that
    asset. This is done in order to get synthetic exposure, or indirect
    exposure, to the asset.


    ### Short 

    When a trader goes short, they are selling a Perpetual contract with the
    belief that the value of the underlying asset will go down in the future.
    Instead of selling the physical asset, traders sell synthetic exposure to
    the asset. This allows them to still speculate on the price without having
    to own the asset.
