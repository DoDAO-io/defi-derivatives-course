    Perpetual contracts are synthetic trading markets that allow traders to take
    positions on a variety of assets using stablecoin (USDC) collateral. These
    contracts can be used to speculate on market movements, hedge risk, or earn
    profits by going long or short with leverage on a futures contract.


    You can start trading with as little as $10 at http://dydx.exchange/.


    ### Long

    If a trader believes that the price of an underlying asset will increase in
    the future, they may choose to enter into a perpetual contract for that
    asset. This is done in order to get synthetic exposure, or indirect
    exposure, to the asset.


    ### Short 

    When a trader goes short, they are selling a Perpetual contract with the
    belief that the value of the underlying asset will go down in the future.
    Instead of selling the physical asset, traders sell synthetic exposure to
    the asset. This allows them to still speculate on the price without having
    to own the asset.


    The working of perpetual contracts/swaps/futures has been explained in
    detail in the introductory chapter. For more information, please refer to
    that section.

    Leverage is the term used to describe how much of your position is being
    borrowed. The higher the leverage, the less funds you need to deposit as
    margin and the more you can borrow to open your position. Borrowing more
    funds comes with more risk, amplifying both your gains and losses, while
    also making it easier for your position to be liquidated at a loss.


    ## Simulation

    dYdX has an excellent
    [article](https://dydx.exchange/blog/leverage-intuition) on risks involved
    in leverage


    The purpose of the article is to assist beginners in gaining an
    understanding of leverage trading and to equip them with the ability to
    minimize risk by adjusting their position sizes in relation to their
    collateral balances. By considering a hypothetical scenario, the article
    aims to provide intuition on appropriate leverage usage. 


    In the scenario, it is assumed that the expected return for Ether over the
    next year is +30%, and a trader has $1000 to invest. The idea of using high
    leverage to maximize gain is tempting, but the volatility of ETH is also
    considered to avoid liquidation. Through simulation, it is shown that using
    5x leverage results in liquidation in 70% of the return paths, with many
    successful paths being liquidated before reaching their full potential. 


    The article concludes by acknowledging that leverage can be beneficial in
    certain cases, such as for creating capital-efficient positions in hedged
    portfolios.
