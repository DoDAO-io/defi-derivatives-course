    ## About Squeeth

    The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either
    going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH).
    The Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of
    this index.


    Squeeth traders can use the contract to take a position on the future value
    of ETH. If they believe ETH will increase in value, they can go long on the
    Squeeth contract. If they believe ETH will decrease in value, they can go
    short.


    The Squeeth contract is a way to trade ETH without having to actually own
    any ETH. This makes it accessible to traders who may not have the capital to
    buy ETH outright.


    ## Working

    Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
    instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries,
    consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20
    token. 


    Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long positions in
    Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the long position
    a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded independently, such as
    in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This composability is a major
    advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to integrate into other
    projects.


    ## Advantages

    #### Compared to options, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No strikes, no expiries

    - No liquidity fragmentation

    - No need to “roll” positions, avoiding risks and costs such as gas and
    spreads paid to market makers

    - Constant gamma (curvature of payoff)


    #### Compared to perpetual swaps, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No liquidations on the long side

    - Compared to a 2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes
    up and lose less when ETH goes down (funding rates for Squeeth are expected
    to be higher due to exposure to pure convexity)

    - The main difference between Squeeth and perpetual protocols is that
    Squeeth is a leveraged position (ETH² payoff) that is a fungible ERC20
    token, enabling it to be traded separately (in uniswap pools, for example,
    or as collateral for loans). This composability is a major advantage to
    Squeeth’s design
