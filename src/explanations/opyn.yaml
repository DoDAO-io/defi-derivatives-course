    The Research Team at Opyn (Zubin Koticha, Andrew Leone, Alexis Gauba, Aparna
    Krishnan), Dave White, and Dan Robinson have invented Squeeth, a new
    financial derivative. Squeeth, also known as squared ETH, is the first Power
    Perpetual that gives traders perpetual exposure to ETH².


    The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either
    going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH)
    and the Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of
    this index.


    Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
    instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries,
    consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20
    token. Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long
    positions in Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the
    long position a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded
    independently, such as in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This
    composability is a major advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to
    integrate into other projects.
