    ## About Squeeth

    The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either
    going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH).
    The Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of
    this index.


    Squeeth traders can use the contract to take a position on the future value
    of ETH. If they believe ETH will increase in value, they can go long on the
    Squeeth contract. If they believe ETH will decrease in value, they can go
    short.


    The Squeeth contract is a way to trade ETH without having to actually own
    any ETH. This makes it accessible to traders who may not have the capital to
    buy ETH outright.


    ## Working

    Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
    instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries,
    consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20
    token. 


    Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long positions in
    Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the long position
    a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded independently, such as
    in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This composability is a major
    advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to integrate into other
    projects.


    #### Long Squeeth

    Long Squeeth is a leveraged position with unlimited ETH² upside, protected
    downside, and no liquidations. Long Squeeth offers pure convexity (ETH²
    payoff), giving it a more favorable payoff than 2x leverage. Compared to a
    2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes up and lose less
    when ETH goes down, but funding rates are expected to be higher due to
    exposure to pure convexity. Long Squeeth holders pay a funding rate for this
    position.


    #### Short Squeeth

    Short Squeeth is a short ETH² position, collateralized with ETH. Traders
    earn a funding rate for taking on this position, paid by long Squeeth
    holders. Short Squeeth positions can be liquidated. A user’s exposure to the
    price of ETH depends on the amount of collateral they have deposited, as
    well as if they own the collateral or have borrowed it with stablecoins
    elsewhere.


    Note, the funding rate for Squeeth is almost always expected to be positive
    due to long Squeeth’s convexity premium, however it is possible to be
    negative (i.e. shorts pay longs if the rate is negative).


    ## Advantages

    #### Compared to options, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No strikes, no expiries

    - No liquidity fragmentation

    - No need to “roll” positions, avoiding risks and costs such as gas and
    spreads paid to market makers

    - Constant gamma (curvature of payoff)


    #### Compared to perpetual swaps, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No liquidations on the long side

    - Compared to a 2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes
    up and lose less when ETH goes down (funding rates for Squeeth are expected
    to be higher due to exposure to pure convexity)

    - The main difference between Squeeth and perpetual protocols is that
    Squeeth is a leveraged position (ETH² payoff) that is a fungible ERC20
    token, enabling it to be traded separately (in uniswap pools, for example,
    or as collateral for loans). This composability is a major advantage to
    Squeeth’s design

    By pairing long ETH with short Squeeth, we get REALLY cool automated
    strategies to generate yield from Squeeth buyers.


    Squeeth strategies are a collection of automated yield strategies for
    different market conditions (🐂 🦀 🐻) that allow users to earn funding,
    paid by the daily funding rate of Squeeth buyers. Users simply deposit ETH
    and the contract automatically manages the strategy.


    The first Automated Squeeth Strategy Opyn launched is the Crab Strategy 🦀


    Opyn’s goal is to enable any team to utilize squeeth’s infrastructure. There
    will be a few Opyn foundational strategies (Crab: neutral exposure to eth,
    Bull: positive exposure to eth , Bear: negative exposure to eth), but
    integration teams can adjust any parameter of the trading strategy to create
    their own strategies or build their own novel strategy with different
    mechanism, triggers, etc.

    The Crab Strategy allows depositors to collect funding without being short
    ETH. The vault pairs short Squeeth with long ETH to create a position with
    an approximate delta of 0 to the price of ETH. This is a classic ‘short
    volatility’ strategy.
