    ## About Squeeth

    The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either
    going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH).
    The Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of
    this index.


    Squeeth traders can use the contract to take a position on the future value
    of ETH. If they believe ETH will increase in value, they can go long on the
    Squeeth contract. If they believe ETH will decrease in value, they can go
    short.


    The Squeeth contract is a way to trade ETH without having to actually own
    any ETH. This makes it accessible to traders who may not have the capital to
    buy ETH outright.


    ## Working

    Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
    instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries,
    consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20
    token. Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long
    positions in Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the
    long position a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded
    independently, such as in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This
    composability is a major advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to
    integrate into other projects.
