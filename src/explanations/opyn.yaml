    ## About Squeeth

    The Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either
    going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH).
    The Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of
    this index.


    Squeeth traders can use the contract to take a position on the future value
    of ETH. If they believe ETH will increase in value, they can go long on the
    Squeeth contract. If they believe ETH will decrease in value, they can go
    short.


    The Squeeth contract is a way to trade ETH without having to actually own
    any ETH. This makes it accessible to traders who may not have the capital to
    buy ETH outright.


    ## Working

    Squeeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index
    instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries,
    consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20
    token. 


    Unlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long positions in
    Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the long position
    a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded independently, such as
    in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This composability is a major
    advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to integrate into other
    projects.


    #### Long Squeeth

    Long Squeeth is a leveraged position with unlimited ETH² upside, protected
    downside, and no liquidations. Long Squeeth offers pure convexity (ETH²
    payoff), giving it a more favorable payoff than 2x leverage. Compared to a
    2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes up and lose less
    when ETH goes down, but funding rates are expected to be higher due to
    exposure to pure convexity. Long Squeeth holders pay a funding rate for this
    position.


    #### Short Squeeth

    Short Squeeth is a short ETH² position, collateralized with ETH. Traders
    earn a funding rate for taking on this position, paid by long Squeeth
    holders. Short Squeeth positions can be liquidated. A user’s exposure to the
    price of ETH depends on the amount of collateral they have deposited, as
    well as if they own the collateral or have borrowed it with stablecoins
    elsewhere.


    Note, the funding rate for Squeeth is almost always expected to be positive
    due to long Squeeth’s convexity premium, however it is possible to be
    negative (i.e. shorts pay longs if the rate is negative).


    ## Advantages

    #### Compared to options, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No strikes, no expiries

    - No liquidity fragmentation

    - No need to “roll” positions, avoiding risks and costs such as gas and
    spreads paid to market makers

    - Constant gamma (curvature of payoff)


    #### Compared to perpetual swaps, Squeeth has several key advantages:

    - No liquidations on the long side

    - Compared to a 2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes
    up and lose less when ETH goes down (funding rates for Squeeth are expected
    to be higher due to exposure to pure convexity)

    - The main difference between Squeeth and perpetual protocols is that
    Squeeth is a leveraged position (ETH² payoff) that is a fungible ERC20
    token, enabling it to be traded separately (in uniswap pools, for example,
    or as collateral for loans). This composability is a major advantage to
    Squeeth’s design

    By pairing long ETH with short Squeeth, we get REALLY cool automated
    strategies to generate yield from Squeeth buyers.


    Squeeth strategies are a collection of automated yield strategies for
    different market conditions (🐂 🦀 🐻) that allow users to earn funding,
    paid by the daily funding rate of Squeeth buyers. Users simply deposit ETH
    and the contract automatically manages the strategy.


    The first Automated Squeeth Strategy Opyn launched is the Crab Strategy 🦀


    Opyn’s goal is to enable any team to utilize squeeth’s infrastructure. There
    will be a few Opyn foundational strategies (Crab: neutral exposure to eth,
    Bull: positive exposure to eth , Bear: negative exposure to eth), but
    integration teams can adjust any parameter of the trading strategy to create
    their own strategies or build their own novel strategy with different
    mechanism, triggers, etc.

    Crab v2 is an automated vault strategy that allows users to earn funding
    (i.e. yield) from being short oSQTH without taking a view on if ETH will
    move up or down.


    The vault does this by creating a mix of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral. The
    strategy contract periodically adjusts its holdings of oSQTH debt and ETH
    collateral to become delta neutral. This means that the positive exposure to
    ETH from the collateral exactly offsets the negative exposure from oSQTH,
    giving the position a neutral exposure to the price of ETH. The maximum
    payoff is if the ETH price remains constant.


    The vault rebalances Monday, Wednesday, Friday around 9:30am PST (or upon
    large price movements in ETH).


    The Crab Strategy is profitable between rebalances as long as ETH moves less
    than an amount based on the funding received from the short Squeeth
    position, subject to transaction fees, slippage, and other costs. In other
    words, the Crab Strategy takes the view that ETH volatility will be low
    (i.e. the price of ETH will be calm, not moving a lot in either direction).


    It aims to make money in USD

    In a bear market it can stack ETH


    At the highest level, the Crab Strategy makes money if ETH moves LESS than
    x% up or down each day.


    The % threshold is variable, meaning it's not fixed. One day it could be
    6.27%, another day it could be 4.5%.


    So, the ideal market condition to be deposited into the Crab Strategy is
    when the price of ETH does not move too much up or down in a given day, or
    over a period of time. 


    ETH can move up or down, but it needs to be within a relatively stable daily
    range (vs being volatile).



    The current profit threshold is based on supply/demand of oSQTH (the Squeeth
    ERC20)


    If relatively more people are buying Squeeth, then the crab profit threshold
    will be higher


    If relatively more people are selling Squeeth, then the crab profit
    threshold will be lower


    *note, the current profit threshold isn't necessarily related to the
    absolute price of oSQTH. It's more of a function of the amount of current
    buyers vs sellers.


    The oSQTH price reflects what the price of ETH is and what the threshold
    should be


    Important: If you deposit into the Crab Strategy when the current profit
    threshold is low `(~3%)` & subsequently withdraw when the threshold is high
    `(~7%)`, you are effectively selling Squeeth when it's inexpensive, and
    buying it back when it's expensive.



    Key takeaways:


    • The current profit threshold is an important daily metric to watch

    • It's better to deposit in the Crab Strategy when the current profit
    threshold is high `(~7%)`

    • It's better to withdrawal from the Crab Strategy when the current profit
    threshold is low `(~3%)`
