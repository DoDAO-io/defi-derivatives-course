    Derivative refers to a type of financial contract whose value is dependent
    on an underlying asset, group of assets, or benchmark. 


    Prices for derivatives derive from fluctuations in the underlying asset.
    These financial securities are commonly used to access certain markets and
    may be traded to hedge against risk. Derivatives can be used to either
    mitigate risk (hedging) or assume risk with the expectation of commensurate
    reward (speculation). Derivatives can move risk (and the accompanying
    rewards) from the risk-averse to the risk seekers.


    The most common underlying assets for derivatives are stocks, bonds,
    commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. Contract values
    depend on changes in the prices of the underlying asset.


    Derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional
    movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings.


    There are two classes of derivative products: "lock" and "option." Lock
    products (e.g., futures, forwards, or swaps) bind the respective parties
    from the outset to the agreed-upon terms over the life of the contract.
    Option products (e.g., stock options), on the other hand, offer the holder
    the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset or
    security at a specific price on or before the option's expiration date. The
    most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options.

    ## Introduction

    Perpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in
    crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded
    derivatives. "Perpetual Swaps" are also know with the name "Perpetual
    Contracts" or "Perpetual Futures". 


    ## What are Perpetual Swaps?

    Perpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of
    something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with
    several advantages: 

    1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long
    as you want) 

    2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)

    3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset

    4. It’s easy to long or short

    5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x
    leverage.


    ## How Perpetual Swaps work?

    If you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several
    options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with
    your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers
    Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go
    to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These
    contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but
    they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements
    (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to
    make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets).
    However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for
    traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage
    their positions, there's another option: the "Perpetual Swap". This type of
    contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration
    date.



    Perpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an
    expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position
    can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one
    can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold
    or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ
    from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis),
    perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This
    is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of
    as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This
    mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of
    the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.


    ## What is Funding Rate?

    Funding is calculated based on the Index Price and sampled Mid-Market Prices
    for the perpetual. When the rate is positive (perpetual trades at a premium
    relative to index), traders who are long will make payments to traders who
    are short. When the rate is negative (perpetual trades at a discount
    relative to index), this is reversed and shorts will pay longs. Traders make
    or receive payments in proportion to the size of their market position.
    **These payments are exchanged solely between traders, and are neither paid
    nor received by the exchange.**


    The funding rate is designed to keep the price of each perpetual market
    close to its Index Price. When the price gets too high, longs pay shorts,
    which encourages more traders to sell or go short, driving the price down.
    When the price gets too low, shorts pay longs, which encourages more traders
    to buy or go long, driving the price up.


    Funding rates are calculated by taking into account the premium, which is
    scaled to have a realization period of 8 hours. What this means is that, for
    example, if a perpetual market trades at a 0.1% premium relative to the
    underlying asset, long traders can expect to pay approximately 0.1% every 8
    hours, while short traders can expect to earn a 0.1% return every 8 hours
    (not accounting for the interest rate component).


    ## Funding Rate Math

    High level calculation for getting funding rate should be same across
    various exchanges. Here is how funding rate is calculated in dydx exchange


    The main component of the funding rate is a premium that takes into account
    market activity for the perpetual. It is calculated for each market, every
    minute (at a random point within the minute) using the formula:


    `Premium = (Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price -
    Impact Ask Price)) / Index Price`


    Where the impact bid and impact ask prices are defined as:


    ```

    Impact Bid Price = Average execution price for a market sell of the impact
    notional value 

    Impact Ask Price = Average execution price for a market buy of the impact
    notional value

    ```

    And the impact notional amount for a market is:


    `Impact Notional Amount = 500 USDC / Initial Margin Fraction`


    ## When Market rate is more than index price?

    When the market is too bullish about an underlying asset, the price gets
    driven up. When this happens, longs pay shorts, which encourages more
    traders to sell or go short, and drives the price down. 


    This presents a nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take
    the short side. They get the funding rate as the discount.

    ## When Market rate is less than index price?

    This can happen when too many people are bearish about the underlying asset.
    When the price gets too low, shorts pay long, which encourages more traders
    to sell or go long, driving the price up. 


    This presents nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the
    long side and they get the funding rate as the discount.
