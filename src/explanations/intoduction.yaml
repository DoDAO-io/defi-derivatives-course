    A derivative is a type of financial contract that gets its value from an
    underlying asset, a group of assets, or benchmark.


    Derivative prices are based on changes in the value of the underlying asset.
    By using these financial securities, investors can trade in different
    markets and reduce their risk exposure. For example, if an investor is
    worried about a stock price going down, they could buy a put option, which
    would give them the right to sell the stock at a set price, no matter how
    low the stock price goes. 


    Derivatives can be utilized to bet on future shifts in asset prices. As an
    example, a call option could be purchased by an investor, giving them the
    option to buy shares at a predetermined price, with the aim of profiting by
    selling the shares if the stock price rises.


    Commonly used assets as the basis for derivatives include stocks, bonds,
    commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. The value of
    the contracts is influenced by changes in the price of the underlying asset.


    Derivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional
    movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings.


    Derivative products can be classified into two categories: "lock" and
    "option." Lock products like futures, forwards, or swaps require both
    parties to stick to the agreed terms throughout the contract. Option
    products, such as stock options, give the holder the choice to buy or sell
    the underlying asset at a set price before the option's expiration, but are
    not mandatory


    The most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options.
    The most commonly traded derivates are futures and options.

    Futures derivatives are financial contracts that obligate the buyer to
    purchase an underlying asset (such as a commodity, currency, or security) at
    a predetermined price on a specified date in the future. Futures contracts
    are used for hedging against price fluctuations, speculation, and managing
    risk in financial markets. 


    **Unlike options, which give the holder the right, but not the obligation,
    to buy or sell an underlying asset, futures contracts are binding and must
    be settled on the specified date, regardless of the current market
    conditions.**


    Future contracts are created by financial institutions, such as exchanges,
    banks, and brokerages. They act as intermediaries between buyers and
    sellers, and provide a centralized platform for trading future contracts.
    Exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the
    Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) are well-known providers of futures
    contracts.


    The terms and specifications of future contracts, such as the underlying
    asset, delivery date, and price, are determined by the exchange and are
    standardized for each type of contract. This makes it easier for buyers and
    sellers to trade future contracts, as they know exactly what they are
    getting into when they enter into a contract.


    Financial institutions that create future contracts also provide clearing
    and settlement services, which ensure that both parties fulfill their
    obligations under the contract. This helps to reduce the risk of default and
    increase the overall stability of the market.


    ## Example

    An example of a future contract is a farmer who is worried about the price
    of corn dropping before the harvest. The farmer can enter into a futures
    contract to sell a certain amount of corn at a predetermined price on a
    specified date in the future. This allows the farmer to lock in a profitable
    price for their crop, even if the actual market price drops.


    On the other side, a cereal manufacturer might be worried about the price of
    corn increasing, which would make it more expensive to produce their cereal.
    The cereal manufacturer can enter into a futures contract to buy corn at a
    predetermined price on a specified date in the future. This allows the
    manufacturer to lock in a lower price for their input, even if the actual
    market price increases.


    Both the farmer and the cereal manufacturer benefit from entering into a
    futures contract, as they are able to hedge against price fluctuations and
    manage their risk.


    ## Important Terms

    **Futures contract** - an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a
    predetermined price in the future.


    **Underlying asset** - the commodity, security, or index underlying the
    futures contract.


    **Delivery date** - the date when the underlying asset must be delivered or
    the contract settled.


    **Settlement price** - the price at which the futures contract is settled or
    the underlying asset is delivered.


    **Long position** - buying a futures contract.



    **Short position** - selling a futures contract.


    **Margin** - the collateral required to hold a futures position.


    **Marking to market** - the process of adjusting the value of a futures
    contract to its current market price.


    **Open interest** - the total number of outstanding futures contracts for a
    specific underlying asset.


    **Basis** - the difference between the futures price and the spot price of
    the underlying asset.


    ## Advantages

    - Future derivatives include the ability to hedge against price
    fluctuations, to manage risk, and to speculate on market movements

    - They also provide liquidity and allow traders to take positions with a
    relatively small amount of capital compared to the underlying assets.


    ## Disadvantages of using future derivatives 

    - The potential for unlimited losses and the fact that they are binding
    contracts that must be settled on the specified date, regardless of market
    conditions. 

    - Margin account with high amount of funds might be needed to be able to
    trade futures

    ## Introduction

    Perpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in
    crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded
    derivatives. "Perpetual Swaps" are also know with the name "Perpetual
    Contracts" or "Perpetual Futures". 


    ## What are Perpetual Futures(or Perpetual Swaps)?

    Perpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of
    something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with
    several advantages: 

    1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long
    as you want) 

    2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)

    3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset

    4. It’s easy to long or short

    5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x
    leverage.


    ## How Perpetual Swaps work?

    If you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several
    options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with
    your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers
    Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go
    to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These
    contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but
    they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements
    (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to
    make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets).
    However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for
    traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage
    their positions, there's another option: the "Perpetual Swap". This type of
    contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration
    date.



    Perpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an
    expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position
    can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one
    can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold
    or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ
    from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis),
    perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This
    is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of
    as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This
    mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of
    the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.


    ## What is Funding Rate?

    Funding is calculated based on the Index Price and sampled Mid-Market Prices
    for the perpetual. When the rate is positive (perpetual trades at a premium
    relative to index), traders who are long will make payments to traders who
    are short. When the rate is negative (perpetual trades at a discount
    relative to index), this is reversed and shorts will pay longs. Traders make
    or receive payments in proportion to the size of their market position.
    **These payments are exchanged solely between traders, and are neither paid
    nor received by the exchange.**


    The funding rate is designed to keep the price of each perpetual market
    close to its Index Price. When the price gets too high, longs pay shorts,
    which encourages more traders to sell or go short, driving the price down.
    When the price gets too low, shorts pay longs, which encourages more traders
    to buy or go long, driving the price up.


    Funding rates are calculated by taking into account the premium, which is
    scaled to have a realization period of 8 hours. What this means is that, for
    example, if a perpetual market trades at a 0.1% premium relative to the
    underlying asset, long traders can expect to pay approximately 0.1% every 8
    hours, while short traders can expect to earn a 0.1% return every 8 hours
    (not accounting for the interest rate component).


    ## Funding Rate Math

    High level calculation for getting funding rate should be same across
    various exchanges. Here is how funding rate is calculated in dydx exchange


    The main component of the funding rate is a premium that takes into account
    market activity for the perpetual. It is calculated for each market, every
    minute (at a random point within the minute) using the formula:


    `Premium = (Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price -
    Impact Ask Price)) / Index Price`


    Where the impact bid and impact ask prices are defined as:


    ```

    Impact Bid Price = Average execution price for a market sell of the impact
    notional value 

    Impact Ask Price = Average execution price for a market buy of the impact
    notional value

    ```

    And the impact notional amount for a market is:


    `Impact Notional Amount = 500 USDC / Initial Margin Fraction`


    ## When Market rate is more than index price?

    When the market is too bullish about an underlying asset, the price gets
    driven up. When this happens, longs pay shorts, which encourages more
    traders to sell or go short, and drives the price down. 


    This presents a nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take
    the short side. They get the funding rate as the discount.

    ## When Market rate is less than index price?

    This can happen when too many people are bearish about the underlying asset.
    When the price gets too low, shorts pay long, which encourages more traders
    to sell or go long, driving the price up. 


    This presents nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the
    long side and they get the funding rate as the discount.
