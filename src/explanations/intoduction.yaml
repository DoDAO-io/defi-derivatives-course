    ## Introduction

    Perpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in
    crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded
    derivatives. "Perpetual Swaps" are also know with the name "Perpetual
    Contracts" or "Perpetual Futures". 


    ## What are Perpetual Swaps?

    Perpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of
    something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with
    several advantages: 

    1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long
    as you want) 

    2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)

    3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset

    4. It’s easy to long or short

    5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x
    leverage.


    ## How Perpetual Swaps work?

    If you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several
    options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with
    your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers
    Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go
    to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These
    contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but
    they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements
    (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to
    make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets).
    However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for
    traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage
    their positions, there's another option: the "Perpetual Swap". This type of
    contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration
    date.



    Perpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an
    expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position
    can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one
    can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold
    or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ
    from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis),
    perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This
    is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of
    as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This
    mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of
    the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.


    Cool, but show me an example!


    Fair enough! To give you a concrete example of how perpetual swaps work,
    we’ll take a look at the 2019 activities of hypothetical trader Alice, who
    believed the price of Ethereum would go up and wanted to find a smart way to
    execute her trade.


    At the start of April 2019, ETH/USD was trading at roughly $4,000. Alice
    wanted to bet on a rise in Ethereum price relative to USD, so she bought 2
    ETH/USD perpetual swap contracts using $8,000 of collateral.


    ```

    $8000 / $4000 = 2 ETH/USD perpetual swap contracts

    ```


    Until the end of June 2019, the Ethereum spot price steadily rose in dollar
    value to about $14,000. As part of the funding rate tethering mechanism
    (this is how a perpetual swap stays close in price to the underlying asset),
    Alice periodically lost a fee or received a rebate to her account. We
    describe this further below, and will in much greater detail in a separate
    post, so don’t worry if this doesn’t make perfect sense yet!


    Alice, being a hypothetical trader, timed the market very well. She
    eventually closed her position after almost 3 months at the local maximum of
    $14,000. In this scenario, her profits, not considering the periodic funding
    rate fees or rebates, were $20,000.


    ```

    profit = position_size * (current_price - entry_price)

    profit = 2 * (14,000 - 4,000)

    profit = 20,000

    ```

    Nicely done, Alice! She did this all without ever holding any Ethereum at
    any point.


    The bottom line

    Perpetual swaps are a cleverly-designed derivative type that have taken the
    market by storm, dominating volumes on most of the leading exchanges. It
    combines desirable qualities of the spot and futures markets, and enables
    traders to use high leverage without the headache of rolling over expiring
    futures contracts. As with any leveraged trade, especially with volatile
    assets like Ethereum, these trades can be risky! Make sure you understand
    them in full before participating.
