    ## What are perpetual Swaps?

    Perpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of
    something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with
    several advantages: 

    1. there is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long
    as you want) 

    2. the underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)

    3. the swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset

    4. it’s easy to short.
