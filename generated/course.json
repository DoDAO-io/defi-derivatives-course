          "details": "Financial derivatives are financial instruments that are linked to a specific financial instrument or indicator or commodity, and through which specific financial risks can be traded in financial markets in their own right. Transactions in financial derivatives should be treated as separate transactions rather than as integral parts of the value of underlying transactions to which they may be linked. The value of a financial derivative derives from the price of an underlying item, such as an asset or index. Unlike debt instruments, no principal amount is advanced to be repaid and no investment income accrues. Financial derivatives are used for a number of purposes including risk management, hedging, arbitrage between markets, and speculation.\n\nFinancial derivatives enable parties to trade specific financial risks (such as interest rate risk, currency, equity and commodity price risk, and credit risk, etc.) to other entities who are more willing, or better suited, to take or manage these risks—typically, but not always, without trading in a primary asset or commodity. The risk embodied in a derivatives contract can be traded either by trading the contract itself, such as with options, or by creating a new contract which embodies risk characteristics that match, in a countervailing manner, those of the existing contract owned. This latter is termed offsetability, and occurs in forward markets. Offsetability means that it will often be possible to eliminate the risk associated with the derivative by creating a new, but \"reverse\", contract that has characteristics that countervail the risk of the first derivative. Buying the new derivative is the functional equivalent of selling the first derivative, as the result is the elimination of risk. The ability to replace the risk on the market is therefore considered the equivalent of tradability in demonstrating value. The outlay that would be required to replace the existing derivative contract represents its value—actual offsetting is not required to demonstrate value.\n\nFinancial derivatives contracts are usually settled by net payments of cash. This often occurs before maturity for exchange traded contracts such as commodity futures. Cash settlement is a logical consequence of the use of financial derivatives to trade risk independently of ownership of an underlying item. However, some financial derivative contracts, particularly involving foreign currency, are associated with transactions in the underlying item.\n\n-----\n",

          "details": "## Introduction\nPerpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded derivatives. \"Perpetual Swaps\" are also know with the name \"Perpetual Contracts\" or \"Perpetual Futures\". \n\n## What are Perpetual Swaps?\nPerpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with several advantages: \n1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long as you want) \n2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)\n3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset\n4. It’s easy to long or short\n5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x leverage.\n\n## How Perpetual Swaps work?\nIf you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets). However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage their positions, there's another option: the \"Perpetual Swap\". This type of contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration date.\n\n\nPerpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis), perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.\n\n## What is Funding Rate?\nFunding is calculated based on the Index Price and sampled Mid-Market Prices for the perpetual. When the rate is positive (perpetual trades at a premium relative to index), traders who are long will make payments to traders who are short. When the rate is negative (perpetual trades at a discount relative to index), this is reversed and shorts will pay longs. Traders make or receive payments in proportion to the size of their market position. **These payments are exchanged solely between traders, and are neither paid nor received by the exchange.**\n\nThe funding rate is designed to keep the price of each perpetual market close to its Index Price. When the price gets too high, longs pay shorts, which encourages more traders to sell or go short, driving the price down. When the price gets too low, shorts pay longs, which encourages more traders to buy or go long, driving the price up.\n\nFunding rates are calculated by taking into account the premium, which is scaled to have a realization period of 8 hours. What this means is that, for example, if a perpetual market trades at a 0.1% premium relative to the underlying asset, long traders can expect to pay approximately 0.1% every 8 hours, while short traders can expect to earn a 0.1% return every 8 hours (not accounting for the interest rate component).\n\n## Funding Rate Math\nHigh level calculation for getting funding rate should be same across various exchanges. Here is how funding rate is calculated in dydx exchange\n\nThe main component of the funding rate is a premium that takes into account market activity for the perpetual. It is calculated for each market, every minute (at a random point within the minute) using the formula:\n\n`Premium = (Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - Impact Ask Price)) / Index Price`\n\nWhere the impact bid and impact ask prices are defined as:\n\n```\nImpact Bid Price = Average execution price for a market sell of the impact notional value \nImpact Ask Price = Average execution price for a market buy of the impact notional value\n```\nAnd the impact notional amount for a market is:\n\n`Impact Notional Amount = 500 USDC / Initial Margin Fraction`\n\n## When Market rate is more than index price?\nWhen the market is too bullish about an underlying asset, the price gets driven up. When this happens, longs pay shorts, which encourages more traders to sell or go short, and drives the price down. \n\nThis presents a nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the short side. They get the funding rate as the discount.\n## When Market rate is less than index price?\nThis can happen when too many people are bearish about the underlying asset. When the price gets too low, shorts pay long, which encourages more traders to sell or go long, driving the price up. \n\nThis presents nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the long side and they get the funding rate as the discount. \n\n## References\n- https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797443-perpetual-funding-rate\n- https://medium.com/derivadex/what-are-perpetual-swaps-130236587df2\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2JwNNkGGlg&list=RDLVh2JwNNkGGlg&start_radio=1\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67QT5hrGl3A\n- https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-perpetual-swap-contract/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfx78LWd3PM\n- https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BPptRKc9o\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUvsWekvkV8\n- https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate",
