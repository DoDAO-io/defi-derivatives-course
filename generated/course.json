          "details": "A derivative is a type of financial contract that gets its value from an underlying asset, a group of assets, or benchmark.\n\nDerivative prices are based on changes in the value of the underlying asset. By using these financial securities, investors can trade in different markets and reduce their risk exposure. For example, if an investor is worried about a stock price going down, they could buy a put option, which would give them the right to sell the stock at a set price, no matter how low the stock price goes. \n\nDerivatives can be utilized to bet on future shifts in asset prices. As an example, a call option could be purchased by an investor, giving them the option to buy shares at a predetermined price, with the aim of profiting by selling the shares if the stock price rises.\n\nCommonly used assets as the basis for derivatives include stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, and market indexes. The value of the contracts is influenced by changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n\nDerivatives can be used to hedge a position, speculate on the directional movement of an underlying asset, or give leverage to holdings.\n\nDerivative products can be classified into two categories: \"lock\" and \"option.\" Lock products like futures, forwards, or swaps require both parties to stick to the agreed terms throughout the contract. Option products, such as stock options, give the holder the choice to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price before the option's expiration, but are not mandatory\n\nThe most common derivative types are futures, forwards, swaps, and options. The most commonly traded derivates are futures and options."

          "details": "## What are Options?\nOptions are a flexible financial tool that consists of a buyer and a seller. The buyer pays a premium for the rights granted by the contract, which gives them the option to buy or sell the underlying asset, depending on the type of option. Options are financial derivatives that provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price and date.\n\nCall and put options are the foundation of various option strategies used for hedging, generating income, or speculation. \n\nCall options give the holder the right to buy the asset at a set price within a specific time frame, while put options provide the right to sell the asset at a set price within a set time frame. Buyers of call options are bullish, while sellers are bearish, and buyers of put options are bearish, while sellers are bullish.\n\nOptions contracts have a set expiration date, and the predetermined price is known as the strike price. These contracts can be bought and sold through retail or online brokers. Options trading can be used for both risk management and speculation, with strategies varying from simple to complex.\n\n## Important Terms\n**Option** - a contract that gives the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a set price.\n\n**Strike price** - the set price at which the option can be exercised.\n\n**Expiration date** - the date when the option contract expires.\n\n**Call option** - a type of option that gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset.\n\n**Put option** - a type of option that gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset.\n\n**Underlying asset** - the security or commodity underlying the option contract.\n\n**Premium** - the price paid for an option.\n\n**Delta** - the rate of change of an option's price relative to the price change of the underlying asset.\n\n**Long position** - owning an option or underlying asset.\n\n**Short position** - the sale of an option or underlying asset not owned by the seller.\n\n## Options Types\n\n#### Calls:\n- Give the holder the right to buy the underlying security at the strike price before expiration.\n- Increase in value as underlying security rises in price (positive delta).\n- Used to speculate on price rise, unlimited upside but max loss is option premium.\n\n#### Puts:\n- Give the holder the right to sell the underlying security at the strike price before expiration.\n- Increase in value as underlying security falls in price (negative delta).\n- Used for hedging, protective puts provide a price floor for investors.\n\n## Example\nAn example of using options in finance would be an investor who owns stock in a company and is concerned about a potential market downturn. The investor can purchase a put option, giving them the right to sell their stock at a set price in the future, regardless of the market conditions. This provides the investor with a \"floor\" for the stock's value, limiting their potential losses in the event of a market downturn.\n\nAnother example is a speculative investor who believes a particular stock will increase in value. Instead of purchasing the stock outright, the investor can purchase a call option, giving them the right to buy the stock at a set price in the future. If the stock's value increases, the call option will increase in value as well, allowing the investor to sell it for a profit.\n\nIn both cases, the options contract allows the investor to potentially benefit from market movements while limiting their downside risk."

          "title": "Futures",
          "shortTitle": "Futures",
          "details": "Futures derivatives are financial contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase an underlying asset (such as a commodity, currency, or security) at a predetermined price on a specified date in the future. Futures contracts are used for hedging against price fluctuations, speculation, and managing risk in financial markets. \n\n**Unlike options, which give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset, futures contracts are binding and must be settled on the specified date, regardless of the current market conditions.**\n\nFuture contracts are created by financial institutions, such as exchanges, banks, and brokerages. They act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, and provide a centralized platform for trading future contracts. Exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) are well-known providers of futures contracts.\n\nThe terms and specifications of future contracts, such as the underlying asset, delivery date, and price, are determined by the exchange and are standardized for each type of contract. This makes it easier for buyers and sellers to trade future contracts, as they know exactly what they are getting into when they enter into a contract.\n\nFinancial institutions that create future contracts also provide clearing and settlement services, which ensure that both parties fulfill their obligations under the contract. This helps to reduce the risk of default and increase the overall stability of the market.\n\n## Example\nAn example of a future contract is a farmer who is worried about the price of corn dropping before the harvest. The farmer can enter into a futures contract to sell a certain amount of corn at a predetermined price on a specified date in the future. This allows the farmer to lock in a profitable price for their crop, even if the actual market price drops.\n\nOn the other side, a cereal manufacturer might be worried about the price of corn increasing, which would make it more expensive to produce their cereal. The cereal manufacturer can enter into a futures contract to buy corn at a predetermined price on a specified date in the future. This allows the manufacturer to lock in a lower price for their input, even if the actual market price increases.\n\nBoth the farmer and the cereal manufacturer benefit from entering into a futures contract, as they are able to hedge against price fluctuations and manage their risk.\n\n## Important Terms\n**Futures contract** - an agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price in the future.\n\n**Underlying asset** - the commodity, security, or index underlying the futures contract.\n\n**Delivery date** - the date when the underlying asset must be delivered or the contract settled.\n\n**Settlement price** - the price at which the futures contract is settled or the underlying asset is delivered.\n\n**Long position** - buying a futures contract.\n\n\n**Short position** - selling a futures contract.\n\n**Margin** - the collateral required to hold a futures position.\n\n**Marking to market** - the process of adjusting the value of a futures contract to its current market price.\n\n**Open interest** - the total number of outstanding futures contracts for a specific underlying asset.\n\n**Basis** - the difference between the futures price and the spot price of the underlying asset.\n\n## Advantages\n- Future derivatives include the ability to hedge against price fluctuations, to manage risk, and to speculate on market movements\n- They also provide liquidity and allow traders to take positions with a relatively small amount of capital compared to the underlying assets.\n\n## Disadvantages of using future derivatives \n- The potential for unlimited losses and the fact that they are binding contracts that must be settled on the specified date, regardless of market conditions. \n- Margin account with high amount of funds might be needed to be able to trade futures "

          "details": "## Introduction\nPerpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded derivatives. \"Perpetual Swaps\" are also know with the name \"Perpetual Contracts\" or \"Perpetual Futures\". \n\n## What are Perpetual Futures/Swaps?\nPerpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with several advantages: \n1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long as you want) \n2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)\n3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset\n4. It’s easy to long or short\n5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x leverage.\n\n## How Perpetual Swaps work?\nIf you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets). However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage their positions, there's another option: the \"Perpetual Swap\". This type of contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration date.\n\n\nPerpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis), perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.\n\nTraders must also put down collateral, known as margin. When the mark price moves against the trader, the resulting losses(funding rate) are deducted from this margin. If the margin balance gets too low, the trader will be liquidated, meaning their position is automatically closed out.\n\n## What is Funding Rate?\nFunding is calculated based on the Index Price and sampled Mid-Market Prices for the perpetual. When the rate is positive (perpetual trades at a premium relative to index), traders who are long will make payments to traders who are short. When the rate is negative (perpetual trades at a discount relative to index), this is reversed and shorts will pay longs. Traders make or receive payments in proportion to the size of their market position. **These payments are exchanged solely between traders, and are neither paid nor received by the exchange.**\n\nThe funding rate is designed to keep the price of each perpetual market close to its Index Price. When the price gets too high, longs pay shorts, which encourages more traders to sell or go short, driving the price down. When the price gets too low, shorts pay longs, which encourages more traders to buy or go long, driving the price up.\n\nFunding rates are calculated by taking into account the premium, which is scaled to have a realization period of 8 hours. What this means is that, for example, if a perpetual market trades at a 0.1% premium relative to the underlying asset, long traders can expect to pay approximately 0.1% every 8 hours, while short traders can expect to earn a 0.1% return every 8 hours (not accounting for the interest rate component).\n\n## Funding Rate Math\nHigh level calculation for getting funding rate should be same across various exchanges. Here is how funding rate is calculated in dydx exchange\n\nThe main component of the funding rate is a premium that takes into account market activity for the perpetual. It is calculated for each market, every minute (at a random point within the minute) using the formula:\n\n`Premium = (Max(0, Impact Bid Price - Index Price) - Max(0, Index Price - Impact Ask Price)) / Index Price`\n\nWhere the impact bid and impact ask prices are defined as:\n\n```\nImpact Bid Price = Average execution price for a market sell of the impact notional value \nImpact Ask Price = Average execution price for a market buy of the impact notional value\n```\nAnd the impact notional amount for a market is:\n\n`Impact Notional Amount = 500 USDC / Initial Margin Fraction`\n\n## When Market rate is more than index price?\nWhen the market is too bullish about an underlying asset, the price gets driven up. When this happens, longs pay shorts, which encourages more traders to sell or go short, and drives the price down. \n\nThis presents a nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the short side. They get the funding rate as the discount.\n## When Market rate is less than index price?\nThis can happen when too many people are bearish about the underlying asset. When the price gets too low, shorts pay long, which encourages more traders to sell or go long, driving the price up. \n\nThis presents nice opportunity to arbitrators or people who want to take the long side and they get the funding rate as the discount. \n\n## References\n- https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797443-perpetual-funding-rate\n- https://medium.com/derivadex/what-are-perpetual-swaps-130236587df2\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2JwNNkGGlg&list=RDLVh2JwNNkGGlg&start_radio=1\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67QT5hrGl3A\n- https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-perpetual-swap-contract/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfx78LWd3PM\n- https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BPptRKc9o\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUvsWekvkV8\n- https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate\n- https://research.paradigm.xyz/cartoon-guide-to-perps\n- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/everlasting-options",

          "details": "\nPower perpetuals are a sub-class of perpetual derivatives. As the name suggests, a power perpetual is a derivative that is linked to a power of the price of an underlying asset. For example, ETH.\n\n## Working\nPower perpetuals are kept in check by means of a regular funding fee, which is paid internally (say, on a daily basis). If the current price of the power perpetual is $MARK at the time of funding, those who are holding long positions may pay those who are holding short positions $(MARK-INDEX) = $(MARK-ETHp).\n\nThis funding fee is sometimes referred to as a premium yield, because it generally represents premium being paid from longs to shorts in return for options-like exposure.\n\n## Example\nThe ETH^2 power perpetual is a contract that allows traders to bet on the future price of ETH. \n\nAssume that ETH is trading at $3, and that the ETH^2 power perpetual is trading at $9.09 at the time funding is paid. Then the longs would have to pay the shorts $(MARK-INDEX) = $(MARK-ETH^2) = $(9.09 - 3^2) = $9.09 - $9.00 = $0.09 per contract.\n\n\n## References\nhttps://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals",

By considering a hypothetical scenario, the article aims to provide intuition on appropriate leverage usage. \n\nIn the scenario, it is assumed that the expected return for Ether over the next year is +30%, and a trader has $1000 to invest. The idea of using high leverage to maximize gain is tempting, but the volatility of ETH is also considered to avoid liquidation. Through simulation, it is shown that using 5x leverage results in liquidation in 70% of the return paths, with many successful paths being liquidated before reaching their full potential. \n\n<image style=\"max-width:500px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/defi-derivatives-course/main/images/dydx/liquidation_chances.png\" />\n\nThe article concludes by acknowledging that leverage can be beneficial in certain cases, such as for creating capital-efficient positions in hedged portfolios.\n\n## Leverage Limits\n[Here](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797403-maximum-leverage-for-perpetuals) are the current leverage limits added by dYdX\n\n| Asset | Leverage Limit |\n| - | - |\n| BTC | 20x |\n| ETH | 20x |\n| All Other Markets | 10x |",

The positions are closed at the liquidation price, which is described below. The insurance fund pays for any profits or losses from liquidations.\n\nWhen a liquidation occurs, the liquidator is allowed to take on the entire account balance of the account being liquidated. This could potentially leave the account with zero margin and zero position. Partial liquidation is also an option, where the liquidator would take on a portion of the account's margin and position.\n\n## Liquidation Penalty\nIf an account is liquidated, the entire value of the account may be taken as a penalty and transferred to the Insurance Fund. The liquidation engine will try to leave funds in accounts of positive value where possible after they have paid the Maximum Liquidation Penalty of 1%.\n\n\n## Example\nTrader A starts with $1000 USDC, then opens a short 1 XYZ (fictional asset) position at $2000 USDC. Their account shows +$3000 USDC, -1 XYZ. The oracle price is $2000 USDC/XYZ, meaning they have a 50% margin.\n\nLater, XYZ's price rises and the oracle reaches $2791 USDC. This drops Trader A's position below the maintenance margin, making it vulnerable to liquidation. The liquidator, with a balance of +$100 USDC, 0 XYZ, liquidates it at the best price of $2800, taking a 1% fee ($28).\n\nThis results in A's account balance of $3000-$2800-$28=$172 USDC, and liquidator's balance of +$2928 USDC, -1 XYZ. Finally, the liquidator closes the short position by selling at $2800 USDC, ending with a balance of +$128 USDC, 0 XYZ.\n\nMore information on Liquidation can be found [here](https://help.dydx.exchange/en/articles/4797401-perpetual-contract-liquidations)",

Keep in mind that these fees take into account referral rewards and network costs for keepers (usually around 1% of total fees).\n\nIt's important to note that GLP is specific to the network where it's minted and is not directly transferable between networks. The price and rewards for GLP tokens will vary between networks. The performance of GLP, including past PnL data and price chart, can be viewed at https://stats.gmx.io. Keep in mind that as a liquidity provider, the profit or loss of GLP holders is tied to the success or failure of leverage traders.\n\n## Minting and Rebalancing\nThe fees for minting GLP, burning GLP, or executing swaps will vary based on whether the action increases or decreases the balance of assets in the index. For example, if the index has a large proportion of ETH and a small proportion of USDC, actions that add to the ETH in the index will incur a high fee, while actions that decrease the ETH will have a low fee.\n\nThe token weights are adjusted to hedge GLP holders based on the trading positions of traders.

Staked for rewards similar to regular GMX tokens\n2. Vested to become actual GMX tokens over a period of one year\n\nEach staked Escrowed GMX token will earn the same amount of Escrowed GMX and ETH / AVAX rewards as a regular GMX token.\n\n### Staked GMX\nStaked GMX receives three types of rewards:\n- Escrowed GMX\n- Multiplier Points\n- ETH / AVAX Rewards\n\n30% of fees generated from swaps and leverage trading are converted to ETH / AVAX and distributed to staked GMX tokens. If you are staking on Arbitrum you would receive ETH, if you are staking on Avalanche then you would receive AVAX. Note that the fees distributed are based on the number after deducting referral rewards and the network costs of keepers, keeper costs are usually around 1% of the total fees.\n\n### Vesting\n\nThe esGMX tokens can be transformed into GMX tokens through a process called vesting. During vesting, the average amount of GMX or GLP tokens used to earn the esGMX rewards will be reserved. For instance, if you staked 1000 GMX and received 100 esGMX tokens, then to vest 100 esGMX tokens, 1000 GMX tokens will be set aside. The actual ratio may vary based on your staked amount and rewards earned.\n\nOnce vesting has been initiated, esGMX tokens will no longer earn rewards. However, the GMX tokens reserved for vesting will still earn rewards. The esGMX tokens will be converted into GMX tokens over a period of 365 days. Once they are fully converted, they can be claimed at any time.\n\nIf you sell GMX or GLP tokens and later wish to vest your esGMX rewards, you'll need to purchase those tokens again. You can use GMX, esGMX or Multiplier Points to fulfill the required reserve amount.\n\nIt's possible to deposit into the vesting vault while ongoing vesting is in progress.\n\n### Floor Price Fund\nThe GMX token has a floor price fund in ETH and GLP. It grows in two ways:\n- GMX/ETH liquidity is provided and owned by the protocol, the fees from this trading pair will be converted to GLP and deposited into the floor price fund\n- 50% of funds received through Olympus bonds are sent to the floor price fund, the other 50% is used for marketing \n\nThe current floor price fund is viewable on the Dashboard.\n\nThe floor price fund helps to ensure liquidity in GLP and provide a reliable stream of ETH rewards for all staked GMX.\n\nAs the floor price fund grows, it can also be used to buyback and burn GMX if the (Floor Price Fund) / (Total Supply of GMX) is less than the market price, this would lead to a minimum price for GMX in terms of ETH and GLP.\n\n",

          "shortTitle": "Squeeth",
          "details": "## About Squeeth\nThe Squeeth contract allows users to trade a special index, ETH², by either going long or short. The ETH² index is referred to as Squeeth (squared-ETH). The Squeeth contract is a collection of contracts that enable trading of this index.\n\nSqueeth traders can use the contract to take a position on the future value of ETH. If they believe ETH will increase in value, they can go long on the Squeeth contract. If they believe ETH will decrease in value, they can go short.\n\nThe Squeeth contract is a way to trade ETH without having to actually own any ETH. This makes it accessible to traders who may not have the capital to buy ETH outright.\n\n## Working\nSqueeth operates similarly to a perpetual swap, tracking the ETH² index instead of ETH. It offers options-like exposure without strikes or expiries, consolidating much of the options market liquidity into a single ERC20 token. \n\nUnlike other perpetual protocols, there is no leverage on long positions in Squeeth, making it impossible to be liquidated. This makes the long position a standard fungible ERC-20 token that can be traded independently, such as in Uniswap pools or as collateral for loans. This composability is a major advantage in Squeeth's design, making it easy to integrate into other projects.\n\n#### Long Squeeth\nLong Squeeth is a leveraged position with unlimited ETH² upside, protected downside, and no liquidations. Long Squeeth offers pure convexity (ETH² payoff), giving it a more favorable payoff than 2x leverage. Compared to a 2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes up and lose less when ETH goes down, but funding rates are expected to be higher due to exposure to pure convexity. Long Squeeth holders pay a funding rate for this position.\n\n#### Short Squeeth\nShort Squeeth is a short ETH² position, collateralized with ETH. Traders earn a funding rate for taking on this position, paid by long Squeeth holders. Short Squeeth positions can be liquidated. A user’s exposure to the price of ETH depends on the amount of collateral they have deposited, as well as if they own the collateral or have borrowed it with stablecoins elsewhere.\n\nNote, the funding rate for Squeeth is almost always expected to be positive due to long Squeeth’s convexity premium, however it is possible to be negative (i.e. shorts pay longs if the rate is negative).\n\n## Advantages\n#### Compared to options, Squeeth has several key advantages:\n- No strikes, no expiries\n- No liquidity fragmentation\n- No need to “roll” positions, avoiding risks and costs such as gas and spreads paid to market makers\n- Constant gamma (curvature of payoff)\n\n#### Compared to perpetual swaps, Squeeth has several key advantages:\n- No liquidations on the long side\n- Compared to a 2x leveraged position, Squeeth will make more when ETH goes up and lose less when ETH goes down (funding rates for Squeeth are expected to be higher due to exposure to pure convexity)\n- The main difference between Squeeth and perpetual protocols is that Squeeth is a leveraged position (ETH² payoff) that is a fungible ERC20 token, enabling it to be traded separately (in uniswap pools, for example, or as collateral for loans). This composability is a major advantage to Squeeth’s design\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/opyn/squeeth-insides-volume-1-funding-and-volatility-f16bed146b7d\n- https://medium.com/opyn/squeeth-primer-a-guide-to-understanding-opyns-implementation-of-squeeth-a0f5e8b95684\n- https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/08/power-perpetuals",

There will be a few Opyn foundational strategies (Crab: neutral exposure to eth, Bull: positive exposure to eth , Bear: negative exposure to eth), but integration teams can adjust any parameter of the trading strategy to create their own strategies or build their own novel strategy with different mechanism, triggers, etc.\n\n### References\n- https://medium.com/opyn/the-best-market-conditions-to-squeeth-zen-bull-crab-and-long-squeeth-2e4fa7d854dc\n- https://medium.com/opyn/stack-eth-opyns-zen-bull-strategy-is-now-live-%EF%B8%8F-f15936f7ecce\n- https://medium.com/opyn/the-best-market-conditions-to-squeeth-zen-bull-crab-and-long-squeeth-2e4fa7d854dc\n- https://medium.com/opyn/automated-squeeth-strategies-crab-v2-is-now-live-8444246610c8",

          "details": "Crab v2 is an automated vault strategy that allows users to earn funding (i.e. yield) from being short oSQTH without taking a view on if ETH will move up or down.\n\nThe vault does this by creating a mix of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral. The strategy contract periodically adjusts its holdings of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral to become delta neutral. This means that the positive exposure to ETH from the collateral exactly offsets the negative exposure from oSQTH, giving the position a neutral exposure to the price of ETH. The maximum payoff is if the ETH price remains constant.\n\nThe vault rebalances Monday, Wednesday, Friday around 9:30am PST (or upon large price movements in ETH).\n\nThe Crab Strategy is profitable between rebalances as long as ETH moves less than an amount based on the funding received from the short Squeeth position, subject to transaction fees, slippage, and other costs. In other words, the Crab Strategy takes the view that ETH volatility will be low (i.e. the price of ETH will be calm, not moving a lot in either direction).\n\nAt the highest level, the Crab Strategy makes money if ETH moves LESS than x% up or down each day. The % threshold is variable, meaning it's not fixed. One day it could be 6.27%, another day it could be 4.5%. So, the ideal market condition to be deposited into the Crab Strategy is when the price of ETH does not move too much up or down in a given day, or over a period of time. \n\nETH can move up or down, but it needs to be within a relatively stable daily range (vs being volatile).\nThe current profit threshold is based on supply/demand of oSQTH (the Squeeth ERC20)\n\nIf relatively more people are buying Squeeth, then the crab profit threshold will be higher. If relatively more people are selling Squeeth, then the crab profit threshold will be lower. The current profit threshold isn't necessarily related to the absolute price of oSQTH. It's more of a function of the amount of current buyers vs sellers.\n\nThe oSQTH price reflects what the price of ETH is and what the threshold should be\n\nImportant: If you deposit into the Crab Strategy when the current profit threshold is low `(~3%)` & subsequently withdraw when the threshold is high `(~7%)`, you are effectively selling Squeeth when it's inexpensive, and buying it back when it's expensive.\n\n\n### Key takeaways:\n- The current profit threshold is an important daily metric to watch\n- It's better to deposit in the Crab Strategy when the current profit threshold is high `(~7%)`\n- It's better to withdrawal from the Crab Strategy when the current profit threshold is low `(~3%)`\n\n\n### References\n- https://medium.com/opyn/automated-squeeth-strategies-crab-v2-is-now-live-8444246610c8",
