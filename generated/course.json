          "details": "## Introduction\nPerpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded derivatives. \"Perpetual Swaps\" are also know with the name \"Perpetual Contracts\" or \"Perpetual Futures\". \n\n## What are Perpetual Swaps?\nPerpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with several advantages: \n1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long as you want) \n2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)\n3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset\n4. It’s easy to long or short\n5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x leverage.\n\n## How Perpetual Swaps work?\nIf you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but they do allow you to increase your exposure to Ethereum's price movements (i.e., using derivatives, you can speculate on Ethereum's price movements to make more profit than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets). However, options and futures contracts do have expiration dates. So for traders who want to use derivatives but don't want to constantly manage their positions, there's another option: the \"Perpetual Swap\". This type of contract dominates the crypto markets because it doesn't have an expiration date.\n\n\nPerpetual swap is a new derivative as of recent years. It does not have an expiry date and also does not have a settlement date, meaning the position can be held forever. The underlying asset is never involved directly, so one can be exposed to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold or borrow the asset. Unlike futures contracts where the price could differ from the spot underlying price (which is commonly referred to as basis), perpetual swaps are always closely pegged to the underlying they track. This is accomplished by using a funding rate mechanism, which can be thought of as either a fee or a rebate that traders receive for holding positions. This mechanism balances the demand from buyers and sellers so that the price of the perpetual swap falls in line with the underlying asset.\n\nCool, but show me an example!\n\nFair enough! To give you a concrete example of how perpetual swaps work, we’ll take a look at the 2019 activities of hypothetical trader Alice, who believed the price of Ethereum would go up and wanted to find a smart way to execute her trade.\n\nAt the start of April 2019, ETH/USD was trading at roughly $4,000. Alice wanted to bet on a rise in Ethereum price relative to USD, so she bought 2 ETH/USD perpetual swap contracts using $8,000 of collateral.\n\n```\n$8000 / $4000 = 2 ETH/USD perpetual swap contracts\n```\n\nUntil the end of June 2019, the Ethereum spot price steadily rose in dollar value to about $14,000. As part of the funding rate tethering mechanism (this is how a perpetual swap stays close in price to the underlying asset), Alice periodically lost a fee or received a rebate to her account. We describe this further below, and will in much greater detail in a separate post, so don’t worry if this doesn’t make perfect sense yet!\n\nAlice, being a hypothetical trader, timed the market very well. She eventually closed her position after almost 3 months at the local maximum of $14,000. In this scenario, her profits, not considering the periodic funding rate fees or rebates, were $20,000.\n\n```\nprofit = position_size * (current_price - entry_price)\nprofit = 2 * (14,000 - 4,000)\nprofit = 20,000\n```\nNicely done, Alice! She did this all without ever holding any Ethereum at any point.\n\nThe bottom line\nPerpetual swaps are a cleverly-designed derivative type that have taken the market by storm, dominating volumes on most of the leading exchanges. It combines desirable qualities of the spot and futures markets, and enables traders to use high leverage without the headache of rolling over expiring futures contracts. As with any leveraged trade, especially with volatile assets like Ethereum, these trades can be risky! Make sure you understand them in full before participating.\n\n\n## What is Funding Rate?\n\n## What if the --- is more than index price?\n\n## What if the --- is less than index price?\n\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/derivadex/what-are-perpetual-swaps-130236587df2\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2JwNNkGGlg&list=RDLVh2JwNNkGGlg&start_radio=1\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67QT5hrGl3A\n- https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-perpetual-swap-contract/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfx78LWd3PM\n- https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BPptRKc9o\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUvsWekvkV8\n- https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate",
