          "details": "## Introduction\nPerpetual Swaps is a new derivative product that gained a lot of traction in crypto world. In fact in Crypto perpetual swaps is the most traded derivatives. \"Perpetual Swaps\" are also know with the name \"Perpetual Contracts\" or \"Perpetual Futures\". \n\n## What are Perpetual Swaps?\nPerpetual swaps are derivatives that let you buy or sell the value of something (that something is usually called an “underlying asset”) with several advantages: \n1. There is no expiry date to your position (i.e., you can hold it as long as you want) \n2. The underlying asset itself is never traded (meaning no custody issues)\n3. The swap price closely tracks the price of the underlying asset\n4. It’s easy to long or short\n5. You can apply use leverage also. Some exchanges provide up to 25x leverage.\n\n## How Perpetual Swaps work?\nIf you want to bet on the price of Ethereum going up, you have several options. You could go to a spot exchange and purchase actual Ethereum with your funds at the specified exchange rate. This immediately transfers Ethereum into your possession for however long you’d like. Or you could go to the derivatives markets and buy an options or futures contract. These contracts do not immediately settle or transfer any Ethereum to you, but they do allow you to increase your “buying power” (i.e., using derivatives, you can buy more Ethereum and profit more from its price movements than you would otherwise be able to on the spot markets). However, options and futures contracts expire at a certain date, meaning you have to constantly manage and reestablish your positions. For traders who want the benefits of derivatives, but don’t want to deal with the complexity of expiration dates, there’s another option, one that dominates the crypto markets: the perpetual swap.\n\nThe perpetual swap is a fairly new type of financial derivative. Unlike the futures and options markets, perpetual swaps do not expire and do not have a settlement date, meaning you can hold your position forever. Unlike the spot markets, the underlying asset is never involved directly, so you can gain exposure to an asset’s price movements without having to actually hold or borrow the asset itself. And lastly, unlike futures contracts where the price can deviate from the spot underlying price (commonly referred to as basis), perpetual swaps should always be closely pegged to the underlying they track. This is accomplished with something called a “funding rate mechanism”, which you can think of as either a fee or a rebate for traders to hold positions. This mechanism balances the buyer and seller demand for the perpetual swap so that its price falls in line with the underlying asset.\n\nIt can sound intimidating without the context provided above, but given all of these advantages, you can see how powerful perpetual swaps can be for traders. Now, add in the fact that you can take on a position with varying degrees of leverage (did someone say 100x?), and you can see why all of these properties have driven perpetual swaps into the spotlight as the darling of the crypto trading ecosystem.\n\n\nCool, but show me an example!\nFair enough! To give you a concrete example of how perpetual swaps work, we’ll take a look at the 2019 activities of hypothetical trader Alice, who believed the price of Ethereum would go up and wanted to find a smart way to execute her trade.\n\nAt the start of April 2019, BTC/USD was trading at roughly $4,000. Alice wanted to bet on a rise in Ethereum price relative to USD, so she bought 2 BTC/USD perpetual swap contracts using $8,000 of collateral.\n\n```\n$8000 / $4000 = 2 BTC/USD perpetual swap contracts\n```\n\nUntil the end of June 2019, the Ethereum spot price steadily rose in dollar value to about $14,000. As part of the funding rate tethering mechanism (this is how a perpetual swap stays close in price to the underlying asset), Alice periodically lost a fee or received a rebate to her account. We describe this further below, and will in much greater detail in a separate post, so don’t worry if this doesn’t make perfect sense yet!\n\nAlice, being a hypothetical trader, timed the market very well. She eventually closed her position after almost 3 months at the local maximum of $14,000. In this scenario, her profits, not considering the periodic funding rate fees or rebates, were $20,000.\n\n```\nprofit = position_size * (current_price - entry_price)\nprofit = 2 * (14,000 - 4,000)\nprofit = 20,000\n```\nNicely done, Alice! She did this all without ever holding any Ethereum at any point.\n\nThe bottom line\nPerpetual swaps are a cleverly-designed derivative type that have taken the market by storm, dominating volumes on most of the leading exchanges. It combines desirable qualities of the spot and futures markets, and enables traders to use high leverage without the headache of rolling over expiring futures contracts. As with any leveraged trade, especially with volatile assets like Ethereum, these trades can be risky! Make sure you understand them in full before participating.\n\n\n## What is Funding Rate?\n\n## What if the --- is more than index price?\n\n## What if the --- is less than index price?\n\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/derivadex/what-are-perpetual-swaps-130236587df2\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2JwNNkGGlg&list=RDLVh2JwNNkGGlg&start_radio=1\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67QT5hrGl3A\n- https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-perpetual-swap-contract/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfx78LWd3PM\n- https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BPptRKc9o\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUvsWekvkV8\n- https://www.coinglass.com/FundingRate",
