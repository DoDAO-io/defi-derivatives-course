## dYdX
 
dYdX is a decentralized crypto derivatives exchange that enables users to trade perpetual contracts, margin trade, and leverage their position. Perpetual contracts are derivative instruments that do not have a fixed expiry date or time, meaning traders can hold a long or short position indefinitely - provided they have the margin to do so. Perpetuals trade closely to spot market prices because they rely on a funding rate system.

By trading perpetuals, crypto traders can take advantage of market movements, reduce risk, and make a profit by going long or short with leverage on a futures contract. 

In this module of the course, we will cover 
- How to trade perpetual contracts in dYdX
- How to take long or short positions
- How leverage works in dYdX
- The types of orders that can be executed using the protocol.
